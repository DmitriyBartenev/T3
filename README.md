# T3 

This is a Twitter clone built using the T3 Stack. The application allows users to post their favorite emojis and view posts left by other users. To start posting, users must first log in with their account.

The T3 Stack includes tRPC and Prisma for server and database management. tRPC provides a type-safe and efficient way to define API endpoints and handle requests and responses between the client and server. Prisma, on the other hand, is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool that simplifies database management and makes it easy to work with databases using a type-safe API. Together, tRPC and Prisma allow for a fast and efficient web application with powerful database management capabilities.

Next.js is used for server-side rendering, TailwindCSS for styling and React for front-end development.
